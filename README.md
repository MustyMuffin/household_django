- ðŸ’¸ **Earnings Tracker**

  - Track earnings from household chores
  - Displays both current and lifetime earnings
  - Leaderboard for lifetime earnings

- ðŸ“Š **Leaderboards**

  - Separate leaderboards for words read and earnings
  - Top performers are styled and highlighted
  - Collapsible cards for clean layout

- ðŸ§  **Admin-Friendly Design**

  - Timestamps for tracking entry dates
  - Easily editable via admin panel or database
  - Uses Djangoâ€™s built-in user authentication

## Technologies Used

- Python / Django 5.1
- PostgreSQL (production database)
- Bootstrap 5 for frontend styling
- Gunicorn + Nginx for production deployment
- GitHub for version control

## Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MustyMuffin/household_django.git
   cd household_django
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Deployment

- Uses Gunicorn as WSGI server and Nginx as a reverse proxy
- PostgreSQL as the production database
- See `django_production_checklist.md` for deployment steps

## Notes

- Leaderboards sort users by words read or earnings
- All book entries track their `date_added` so data is visible historically
- Models include `BooksRead`, `WordsRead`, and `EarnedWage`
- Pages were renamed to Words globally for accuracy
