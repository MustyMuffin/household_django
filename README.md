# Household Management App
README v0.2

This Django project was created by a parent who wanted to motivate their young laborers. It is a household productivity and tracking tool, designed to manage and gamify various aspects of home life by awarding experience points to various chores or reading tasks. The leveling curve is customizable by admin, with a recommended base of 100-200 and a curve of 1.1 to 1.4. 
It also allows users to track books read (and total words), monitor earnings from chores, and maintain leaderboards to encourage friendly competition.

## In developement 

actively in development (test branch):
- Badges system that allows site admin to create badges that track admin selected number of books read, amount of words read, frequency of chores done, and total "wage" earned from chores. 

planned for future development:
- Schedule function for scheduling chores (development not started)
- Stats section for displaying various data information such as who did what chore the most last week/month/year, who read most books, etc. 

Also development related:
- A completely from scratch version of this application with an aim to recreate the architecture for better overall optimisation and increased modularity.

- Recommended to use Gunicorn as WSGI server and Nginx as a reverse proxy
- PostgreSQL as the recommended database

## Notes

- Currently this needs to be hosted and served locally but if there is enough interest, I will host on website over the internet as well. I will not do so until I can promise users full data encryption, both at rest and in travel.
